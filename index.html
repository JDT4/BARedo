              <p>Situated in the centre of Grasmere village at the heart of the English Lake District, the Self Catering apartments are an integral part of the house which was built in 1850 on the instructions of a Manchester businessman. Around 1890 it changed use and became the Grasmere Catholic College. The adjacent street is named after it, i.e. College Street. The property lies 100 metres from the churchyard where William Wordsworth is buried.</p>
              <p>During the first World War (1914-18) the house was commandeered for use as a convalescent home for soldiers recovering from their injuries received at the 'front'.</p>
              <p> At the time of World War II (1939-45) the house had once again changed use, this time to a vegetarian hotel. Around 1970 the property was converted to its present use, self catering holiday apartments. In 1992, and again in 1996 substantial improvements were carried out and the Guest House was constructed.</p>
              <p>Both businesses, i.e. the Self Catering Apartments and the Bed & Breakfast Guest House, are run by separate proprietors, Pat and Brian Taylor and Christine and Ian Dandy respectively, and whilst they are run as separate entities, they do support each other to the benefit of both the owners and guests alike.</p>
