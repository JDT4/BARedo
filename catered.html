        <h2>About Beck Allans</h2>
        <p>Beck Allans is a traditionally built, Lakeland house which is concealed in the grounds and quietly situated adjacent to and overlooking the River Rothay and surrounding fells. We are located in the centre of Grasmere village, in the Heart of the English Lake District, 4 miles from Ambleside, 8 miles from Windermere and 12 miles from Keswick. The guest house certainly provides a high degree of comfort and cleanliness being double glazed, centrally heated, tastefully decorated and well furnished throughout the accommodation. In the guest house our superior rooms contain kingsize, super kingsize and twin options.</p>
